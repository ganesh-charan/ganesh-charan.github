# 🎮 Memory Game

A fun and interactive web-based memory challenge where the player must remember and repeat a random pattern generated by the computer. Each level adds a new color to the sequence, testing how far your memory can go.

## 🧠 Game Overview

The game displays a sequence of colored buttons — **red**, **blue**, **green**, and **yellow**.  
Your task: **repeat the exact sequence** in the correct order.  
Each round gets tougher as the pattern grows longer. One mistake, and it’s game over!
